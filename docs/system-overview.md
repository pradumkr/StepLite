# System Overview

## Introduction

The Distributed Workflow Engine is a robust, scalable workflow orchestration platform designed to execute complex business processes reliably. Built with Spring Boot and Java, it provides a state machine-based workflow execution engine similar to AWS Step Functions.

## Key Features

- **State Machine Workflows**: Define workflows as a series of connected states
- **Multiple State Types**: Support for Task, Choice, Wait, Success, and Fail states
- **Error Handling**: Basic error catching and logging (retry logic planned for future releases)
- **Conditional Logic**: Dynamic branching based on data conditions
- **Idempotency**: Safe execution of workflow executions (prevents duplicates)
- **Scalability**: Worker-based execution with Redis-backed queuing
- **Observability**: Built-in metrics, health checks, and structured logging

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Event-Driven Design
- Workflow execution is driven by state transitions
- Asynchronous processing with worker threads
- Event sourcing for execution history

### 2. Fault Tolerance
- **Basic error handling** with catch blocks and error states
- **Timeout handling** for long-running tasks
- **Graceful error handling** with planned compensation paths
- **Note**: Automatic retry mechanisms and compensation actions are planned but not yet implemented

### 3. Scalability
- Horizontal scaling through worker instances
- Redis-based execution queue
- Stateless API design

### 4. Observability
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Prometheus metrics export
- Health check endpoints
- OpenTelemetry integration

## System Components

### Core Components

1. **Workflow Engine**: Central orchestration logic
2. **State Machine**: Executes workflow state transitions
3. **Task Registry**: Manages available task handlers
4. **Execution Service**: Coordinates workflow execution
5. **Worker Service**: Background task processing

### Data Layer

1. **PostgreSQL**: Primary data store for workflows and execution history
2. **Redis**: Execution queue and caching
3. **Flyway**: Database migration management

### API Layer

1. **REST Controllers**: HTTP endpoints for workflow operations
2. **DTOs**: Data transfer objects for API communication
3. **Validation**: Input validation and error handling

## Workflow Execution Model

### Execution Flow

1. **Registration**: Workflow definition is registered via API
2. **Execution**: Workflow execution is started with input data
3. **State Processing**: States are executed sequentially or conditionally
4. **Task Execution**: External tasks are processed by workers
5. **State Transition**: Data flows between states
6. **Completion**: Workflow reaches terminal state (Success/Fail)

### State Types

- **Task**: Executes external actions
- **Choice**: Conditional branching logic
- **Wait**: Time-based delays
- **Success**: Successful completion
- **Fail**: Error termination

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.x, Java 17
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 12+
- **Cache/Queue**: Redis 6+
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Micrometer
- **Tracing**: OpenTelemetry

## Deployment Model

- **Containerized**: Docker-based deployment
- **Microservices**: Single application with modular design
- **Stateless**: API instances can be scaled horizontally
- **Database**: Persistent PostgreSQL storage
- **Queue**: Redis for execution queuing

## Security Features

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input sanitization and validation
- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input validation
- **XSS Protection**: Output encoding and content validation
- **Webhooks**: Event-driven callbacks (planned for future releases)

## Performance Characteristics

- **Throughput**: Configurable worker thread pools
- **Latency**: Sub-second API response times
- **Scalability**: Linear scaling with worker instances
- **Resource Usage**: Efficient memory and CPU utilization

## Integration Points

- **REST APIs**: HTTP-based integration
- **Webhooks**: Event-driven callbacks
- **Task Handlers**: Pluggable task execution
- **External Systems**: Database, message queues, APIs
